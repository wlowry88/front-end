SumZero Front-End Evaluation
=============================

Greetings Fellow Developer!

Welcome to the evaluation. The purpose of this short test is to give us a better sense of how you think as a front-end dev. The test has a two hour time-limit and there's lots for you to work on in that time period. Don't worry about getting the exercise completely, 100% right -- we know this is a timed exercise and we'd like you to work as quickly as you are able, while remaining efficient. Just focus on making sure the code works the way it's intended while making the design look as nice as possible.

A few notes before you begin:

* It's strongly recommended you use jQuery for this project. You don't have to of course, but it sure makes things easier. A copy of the latest jQuery is included with the repo.
* You can use whatever plugins/frameworks you'd, but try not to use something that completely solves the problem. Remember, we want to get a sense for what your skills are, and copying/pasting a chunk of framework code into the repo isn't necessarily going to tell us that you 'get' JavaScript.
* Feel free to Google for stuff as needed.

You're going to be asked to recreate form within a modal dialog box. The steps and directions to do so are listed on the accompanying image files step1.png and step2.png. At the very minimum, your code should:

1. Ensure a modal window opens up when the "Edit" link is clicked
2. Close the modal windown when the cancel or "X" button is clicked
3. Clone the fields when the "Add Another Manager" button is clicked
4. Update the content on the main page when the "Update" button is clicked in the modal.

The image files you need for the project are inside the accompanying image directory. If you have any questions during the evaluation, feel free to ask one of the developers. 

Good luck and happy front-ending!
